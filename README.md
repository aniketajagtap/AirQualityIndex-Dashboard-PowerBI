## Data Import and Transformation:
1. Data Import: The project began with importing air quality data from various sources into Power BI. This data included daily measurements of AQI (Air Quality Index), and pollutant levels such as NO, CO, SO2, PM2.5, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene.

2. Data Cleaning: The imported data was meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy. This included removing blank rows, handling missing values, and correcting any inconsistencies within the dataset.

3. Data Transformation: Various transformations were applied to the data to prepare it for analysis. This involved formatting date columns, creating new calculated columns, and aggregating data at different levels to facilitate meaningful insights.

## Visualizations:
1. Line Chart (Date vs AQI):
A line chart was created to visualize the trend of AQI over time. This chart allows users to observe how air quality has changed across different cities and dates.

2. Stacked Column Charts (Most and Least Polluted Cities):
Two stacked column charts were created to represent the most polluted and least polluted cities based on AQI values. These charts provide a clear comparison of air quality across different cities.

3. Pie Chart (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene Levels):
A pie chart was used to indicate the relative levels of Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene, three harmful pollutants. This chart offers a quick snapshot of the composition of these pollutants in the air.

4. Map Visualization (Cities with AQI Data):
A map of India was included in the dashboard, with markers labeling the cities for which AQI data is available. This visual makes it easy to identify geographic patterns in air quality across the country.

5. Cards (NO, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 Levels):
Individual cards were created to display the current levels of NO, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 for selected cities. These cards provide quick access to critical pollutant information.

## Interactive Features:
A slicer was implemented to allow users to select a specific city. This selection dynamically updates the entire dashboard, enabling users to view data and visualizations for the chosen city. The slicer provides an intuitive way to explore the air quality data for different cities individually.
